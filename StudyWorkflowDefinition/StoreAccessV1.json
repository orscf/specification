    "description": "NOTE: This is not intended be a 'RESTful' api, as it is NOT located on the persistence layer and is therefore NOT focused on doing CRUD operations! This HTTP-based API uses a 'call-based' approach to known BL operations. IN-, OUT- and return-arguments are transmitted using request-/response- wrappers (see [UJMW](https://github.com/KornSW/UnifiedJsonMessageWrapper)), which are very lightweight and are a compromise for broad support and adaptability in REST-inspired technologies as well as soap-inspired technologies!",
